# Lab 12a Feedback

## Preparing Your Computer

### 1

- [ ] "...can be loaded from disk, PHP files..." => "...the PHP files..."
- [ ] remove Cloud9 ref?
- [ ] I'm not sure what the "You may instead be using a real or virtual server.." sentence is about here.
- [ ] "Alternatively, you may want...." doesn't seem to jibe with the previous paragraph. Should that be changed to "You may want to use an online coding environment...."?

### 2

- [ ] "..accepting the installation location, and options provided..." => "accepting all defaults for the installation..."
- [ ] Delete the "and then start the XAMPP server", as that's step 3?
  
### 3

- [ ] omit the "(the file `xampp-control.exe`...)" part and just say "start XAMPP Control Panel from the Windows Start menu"?

### 4

- (first sentence) "...to your htdocs folder" => "...in your htdocs folder"
- Is the first sentence an instruction? If not, when the following two paragraphs say "...into the lab12a folder", it's confusing as there is no lab12a folder.

## 12.1

The numbering is off here: it jumps from 1 to 3.

### 12.1.2

- [ ] "...inside of..." => "...inside ~~of~~..."
- [ ] maybe have a comment in the starting code for where the desired echo should go?

### 12.1.3

- [ ] "View Source" => "View Page Source"

### 21.1.7

- [ ] "...in using a variable..." => "...in that it uses a variable..."

### 21.1.9

- [ ] the link can just use "php.net/date"
- [ ] Might the `https://www.php.net/datetime_format` link be more useful? (Unless the intent was to make the reader dig...which is fine!)


## TYK#1

"Already" is used twice in the first sentence.

### 1

- [ ] Would it be useful to provide a hint that `<?php ?>` is necessary here as well (at least for this first TYK?)
- [ ] Readers might wonder whether they're "allowed" to alter the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag. Mix things up by having them alter a `$src` variable in the php section? You can hint that it's somewhat like the `$dimensions` variable that's done for them?

## 12.3

### 12.3.5

- [ ] "...how many days, months, and years..." => just do the days? (Since the next step covers months and years.) If so, leave out the "For instance..."

## 12.4

Put the years calculation into the html, as all the other calcs are there, too.

### 12.4.2 

- [ ] "Replace the number of..." => "Format the number of..."
- [ ] My output for seconds has the thousands separator kicking in...isn't this the default behaviour for number_format?
