## Lab 8

### 8.2

#### step 1

- [ ] editor names should likely be capitalized
- [ ] visual code => VS Code (or Visual Studio Code)
- [ ] brackets is no longer supported by Adobe as of Sept. 1, 2021 (their site now suggests using VS Code!)

### 8.3

#### step 2

- [ ] The "since the file does not exist" doesn't make sense, since it was created in step 1

### 8.6

### step 2

- [ ] closing bracket missing "...and then view the JavaScript console)."

### step 3

- [ ] remove comma after "...since const, variable can't be changed"

### step 4

- [ ] last sentence: "...which, **as** this example illustrates...."

### step 6

- [ ] would personally have added an additional entry for isNull (the "object" result is...interesting)

### step 10

- [ ] NaN (not Nan)
- [ ] might be useful to mention what happens if Cancel is pressed at the prompt...
